Amplify Analytics solution helps you to leverage information about your APIs usage to not only manage your technology infrastructure and operations better, but also to generate additional insights for your businesses. For more information on Amplify Analytics solution, see **LINK**.

Operational Insights is part of the Amplify Analytics solution, and its advantage over [API Gateway Traffic Monitor](/docs/apimanager_analytics/analytics_intro/) is that it allows you to export and visualize your API Gateway metrics and traffic data using a third-party analytics stack: [Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) (ELK), and observe millions of requests across different API Gateway instances in a long time frame.

This documentation describes how to set up and manage your metrics database, how to configure API Gateway, and how to use Operational Insights to monitor your API Gateway domain.
